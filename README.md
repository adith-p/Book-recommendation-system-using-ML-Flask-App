# Book-recommendation-system-using-ML-Flask-App
Welcome to my book recommendation system repository! This system uses collaborative filtering to recommend books based on user Input. It's a powerful tool that can help users discover new books that they'll love.

In addition to the recommendation system, this project also includes a blogging system where users can share their thoughts and reviews on books. Users can also purchase recommended books through affiliate links, making it a convenient and seamless experience.

This project is built using Python and several popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. It's a great example of how data science techniques can be applied to real-world problems.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the recommendation system. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you!
